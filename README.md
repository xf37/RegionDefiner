# RegionDefiner Notebook and Its Data

This folder provides a comprehensive suite of resources designed to support the implementation, testing, and validation of the RegionDefiner methodology, as detailed in our recent academic publication. The contents include:

1. RegionDefiner Notebook: A Jupyter notebook containing the complete implementation of the RegionDefiner algorithm. It features all essential code and libraries to ensure seamless testing and replication of the described methodologies.
2. Supporting Documentation: Detailed explanations of several regionalization algorithms, which are integral to the file search capabilities within RegionDefiner.
3. A shapefile representing US farm: An illustrative example in our paper for executing the regionalization algorithms (in Pysal spopt) locally and demonstrates the practical application and visualization capabilities of the RegionDefiner framework.

As presented in our publication, these resources empower researchers and practitioners to thoroughly test, validate, and extend the RegionDefiner response framework. We aim to advance understanding and application in regional analysis and optimization by providing robust documentation and practical examples.
