# RegionDefiner
RegionDefiner Notebook and Its Data

This folder provides a comprehensive suite of resources designed to support the implementation, testing, and validation of the RegionDefiner methodology, as detailed in our recent academic publication. The contents include:

RegionDefiner Notebook: A Jupyter notebook containing the complete implementation of the RegionDefiner algorithm. It features all essential code, libraries, and our OpenAI API key to ensure seamless testing and replication of the described methodologies.
Supporting Documentation:
Detailed explanations of the max-p problem and p-region algorithms, among others, which are integral to the file search capabilities within RegionDefiner.
US Farm Shapefile: A shapefile representing US farm data, used as an illustrative example in our paper. This dataset is essential for executing the Spopt regionalization algorithm locally and demonstrates the practical application and visualization capabilities of the RegionDefiner framework.
These resources collectively empower researchers and practitioners to thoroughly test, validate, and extend the RegionDefiner response framework as presented in our publication. By providing robust documentation and practical examples, we aim to advance understanding and application in regional analysis and optimization.
